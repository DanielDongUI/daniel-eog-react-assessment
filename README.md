Hi

Good day, and hope you are doing great!

This is Daniel, and I sincerely appreciate for giving me the opportunity. The code assessment is very well-designed, and I have enjoyed doing it a lot. 

The completed project has been pushed to Github on Tuesday, and I just want to add a few words about the two extra features that I have implemented. The first one is the left side-bar, which displays APIâ€™s locational information, and contains a search box that users can specify the sensor data source and the time window. The second one is in the top-bar, which displays recorded plot data-tip, and each data source is toggleable via buttons.

Once again, thank you so much for giving me this opportunity to do this coding interview, and I really wish that I can join your tech team soon. Please feel free to contact/email me if you have any questions!

Sincerely,

Daniel Dong
