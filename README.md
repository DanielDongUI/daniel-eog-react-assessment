A letter to EOG tech team

Hi

Good day, and hope you are doing great!

This is Daniel, and I sincerely appreciate for giving me the opportunity. The code assessment is very well-designed, and I have enjoyed doing it a lot. 

The completed project has been pushed to Github, and I just want to add a few words about the two extra features that I have implemented. The first one is the left side-bar, which displays APIâ€™s locational information, and contains a search box that users can specify the sensor data source and the time window. The second one is in the top-bar, which displays recorded plot data-tip, and each data source is toggleable via buttons.

The visualization page can definitely be improved, especially on styling, if I had spent the full given week. I chose to hand-in earlier because I believe you are focusing more on React aspects, so I felt getting the project done under a more constraint time might be a good indicator of my familiarity with React.

Besides UI/UX, there is absolutely a lot that can be improved on structure design and code. On data management, I only used Apollo for data fetching and passed the fetched data to Redux. Using Sagas for asynchronous fetching is beneficial if the project gets larger. Lastly, I want to apologize for my bad commit messages (and it is really after I pushed everything to Github, I found you are explicitly asking for good git log hygiene).

Once again, thank you so much for giving me this opportunity to do this coding interview, and I really wish that I can join your tech team soon. Please feel free to contact/email me if you have any questions!

Sincerely,

Daniel Dong
